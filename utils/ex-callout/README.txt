Concept:

"EZ Callout" allows user to forward messages from cave network to a surface node that is tethered to a VZW cellphone. 
This script would run on a companion computer that is connected to the cellphone's hotspot (or other internet connection).
Messages can be automatically forwarded to a destination callout or dispatch email address or SMS recipient
